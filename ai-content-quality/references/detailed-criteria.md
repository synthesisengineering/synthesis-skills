## Language and Tone Patterns

### 1. Undue Emphasis on Importance and Symbolism

**Pattern:** LLMs inflate the significance of subjects by connecting them to broader, often grandiose themes.

**Common phrases:**

- "stands as a testament to..."
- "plays a vital/significant/crucial role in..."
- "underscores its importance..."
- "leaves a lasting impact/legacy..."
- "serves as a reminder of..."
- "represents a milestone in..."
- "embodies the spirit of..."
- "symbolizes..."
- "carries enhanced significance..."

**Examples:**

- A local restaurant becomes "not just a place to eat, but a testament to community resilience"
- A minor product update "represents a watershed moment in technological innovation"
- A town is described as "a symbol of cultural heritage and economic vitality"

**Why this happens:** LLMs regress to the mean -- they emphasize what is statistically common (positive, grand descriptions) rather than what is actually notable or unique about the subject.

**The fix:** Ask: Is this subject genuinely significant in the way described? If not, describe it accurately rather than inflating its importance.

---

### 2. Promotional and Travel Brochure Language

**Pattern:** Content reads like marketing copy, especially for locations, cultural topics, or products.

**Common phrases:**

- "rich cultural heritage"
- "breathtaking"
- "stunning natural beauty"
- "must-visit destination"
- "captivating"
- "nestled in the heart of..."
- "boasts..."
- "offers a unique blend of..."
- "renowned for..."
- "fascinating"
- "diverse and vibrant"
- "hidden gem"

**Example passage:**

"Nestled in the heart of the countryside, the town of Millbrook boasts a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty. This captivating destination offers visitors a unique blend of historic charm and modern amenities, making it a must-visit location for those seeking an authentic experience."

**The fix:** Replace promotional adjectives with specific, factual descriptions. What specifically makes it interesting? What would someone actually experience there?

---

### 3. Editorial Commentary and Meta-Analysis

**Pattern:** LLMs inject interpretation, importance judgments, or explicit guidance about what readers should think.

**Common phrases:**

- "it's important to note that..."
- "it is worth mentioning/noting..."
- "notably..."
- "significantly..."
- "interestingly..."
- "surprisingly..."
- "crucially..."
- "no discussion would be complete without..."
- "one cannot overlook..."
- "it should be emphasized that..."

**Why this violates journalistic standards:** Objective reporting presents facts and allows readers to form their own interpretations. These phrases signal editorializing.

**Example:**

"It's important to note that this development represents a significant shift in the industry, and it is worth emphasizing that stakeholders should pay close attention to these emerging trends."

**The fix:** State the facts. Trust readers to determine importance. If something is genuinely important, demonstrate it through evidence rather than declaring it.

---

### 4. Superficial Analysis with Participial Phrases

**Pattern:** Sentences end with "-ing" phrases that add shallow analytical commentary without substance.

**Structure:** [Statement], [participial phrase adding supposed insight]

**Examples:**

- "The company announced new policies, highlighting its commitment to sustainability."
- "The festival attracts thousands of visitors annually, underscoring the region's cultural importance."
- "The research revealed new findings, demonstrating the team's innovative approach."

**Why this is problematic:** The participial phrase adds apparent depth without providing actual analysis or evidence.

**The fix:** Either provide real analysis with evidence, or let the statement stand on its own.

---

### 5. Negative Parallelism

**Pattern:** LLMs overuse the "not X but Y" construction to create artificial contrast and drama.

**Common structures:**

- "It's not just X, but Y"
- "It's not only X, but also Y"
- "It is not merely X; it is Y"
- "X represents not only Y but also Z"

**Examples:**

- "The restaurant is not just a place to eat, but a cornerstone of community gathering."
- "This technology is not merely an improvement, but a revolutionary breakthrough."
- "The policy change represents not only a shift in strategy but also a commitment to transparency."

**The fix:** Use this structure sparingly and only when the contrast is genuine and significant.

---

### 6. Overuse of Transition Words and Formal Conjunctions

**Pattern:** Excessive, stilted use of transitional phrases that create an essay-like or overly formal tone.

**Common overused transitions:**

- "Moreover,"
- "Furthermore,"
- "Additionally,"
- "In addition,"
- "Nevertheless,"
- "On the other hand,"
- "Consequently,"
- "As a result,"

**Why this signals AI:** While professional writing uses transitions, LLMs overrely on a narrow set and place them mechanically rather than naturally.

**Human writing:** Uses varied transitions, including implicit transitions through logical flow, rather than explicit conjunctions at every paragraph break.

**The fix:** Let ideas connect through logical flow. When transitions are needed, vary them and use the simplest option that works.

---

### 7. Section-Ending Summaries

**Pattern:** Paragraphs or sections end with explicit summary statements, mimicking academic essay structure.

**Common phrases:**

- "In summary,"
- "In conclusion,"
- "Overall,"
- "To summarize,"
- "Ultimately,"
- "In essence,"

**Why this is problematic:** News articles, blogs, and most media content do not summarize sections like essays. Content flows naturally to the next point without explicit meta-commentary about summarizing.

**The fix:** Remove these phrases. If a section needs a summary to be understood, the section itself may need restructuring.

---

### 8. The Rule of Three

**Pattern:** Grouping ideas, traits, or examples in threes -- a legitimate rhetorical device that LLMs overuse formulaically.

**Common forms:**

- Three adjectives: "innovative, impactful, and transformative"
- Three short phrases: "boost morale, increase productivity, and foster collaboration"
- Three examples: "keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities"
- Three qualities: "creative, smart, and funny"

**Why LLMs overuse this:** The rule of three is prevalent in training data (human writing, marketing, speeches), so LLMs default to it as a "safe" structure.

**Human writing:** Uses varied numbers of items naturally -- sometimes two, sometimes four, sometimes an uneven list. Does not mechanically group everything in threes.

**Detection tip:** Look for consistent triadic structure across multiple sentences and paragraphs.

**The fix:** Vary list lengths. Sometimes two items are enough. Sometimes four or five are warranted. Let content dictate structure, not formula.

---

### 9. Passive Voice and "Has Been Described As" Construction

**Pattern:** Overreliance on passive constructions and indirect attribution.

**Common phrases:**

- "[Subject] has been described as..."
- "[Subject] is widely regarded as..."
- "[Subject] is considered to be..."
- "[Subject] has been praised for..."
- "[Subject] is known for..."

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs use this construction to hedge when they lack specific knowledge or sources. It creates an illusion of authority without providing actual attribution.

**The fix:** Use direct statements with specific attribution: "According to [expert/organization], [subject]..."

---

### 10. Uniform Sentence and Paragraph Length

**Pattern:** Mechanically consistent structure -- every sentence approximately the same length, every paragraph the same size.

**Why this signals AI:** Human writing has natural rhythm and variation. Writers use short sentences for emphasis, long sentences for complex ideas, varied paragraph lengths for pacing.

**Detection tip:** Scan the visual structure of text. AI-generated content often looks like uniform blocks.

**The fix:** Vary sentence and paragraph length deliberately. Short sentences punch. Longer sentences can carry complexity when needed, building toward a point with subordinate clauses and careful construction. Some paragraphs should be brief. Others need room to develop.

---

## Style and Structural Indicators

### 11. Excessive Use of Em Dashes

**Pattern:** Overuse of em dashes where humans would use commas, parentheses, or colons.

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs were trained on professional writing where em dashes appear more frequently than in casual or journalistic writing. They default to em dashes for all parenthetical insertions.

**Note:** This indicator has limited shelf life as AI systems learn to avoid it. However, in combination with other patterns, it remains useful.

**Human pattern:** Uses varied punctuation (parentheses for asides, commas for clauses, colons for elaboration).

**The fix:** Use the punctuation mark that best fits the function. Em dashes for dramatic interruption or emphasis. Parentheses for true asides. Commas for standard clauses.

---

### 12. Bulleted Lists with Bolded Lead-ins

**Pattern:** Formulaic bullet points where each item begins with a bolded term followed by a colon and explanation.

**Structure:**

- **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale easily.
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to various use cases.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes resource utilization.

**Why this signals AI:** This structure appears in AI-generated content far more than in human journalism or blog writing. Humans vary their list formats more naturally.

**Detection tip:** This pattern is especially strong when combined with generic bolded terms that simply restate what follows.

**The fix:** Vary list formats. Sometimes bullets without bold leads work better. Sometimes a numbered list fits. Sometimes prose serves better than a list at all.

---

### 13. Excessive Bolding and Formatting

**Pattern:** Mechanical, over-consistent use of bold text for key terms throughout an article.

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs sometimes emphasize terms they deem "important" without understanding that excessive formatting reduces readability.

**Human pattern:** Strategic use of formatting -- headlines, subheads, occasional emphasis, but not mechanical bolding of every "important" term.

**The fix:** Bold sparingly. If everything is emphasized, nothing is.

---

### 14. Emoji Usage in Inappropriate Contexts

**Pattern:** Emojis appearing in article text, headers, or formal content where they do not belong.

**Why this signals AI:** Some LLMs insert emojis to "add emotion" or "engage readers," but do so without understanding context or audience appropriateness.

**Note:** Emojis in social media posts, casual blogs, or intentionally informal content are normal. The tell is their appearance in contexts where they are inappropriate.

---

### 15. Markdown Formatting Mixed with Standard Text

**Pattern:** Presence of Markdown syntax elements in published content.

**Common artifacts:**

- Asterisks for bold/italic: `*emphasis*` or `**strong**`
- Underscores for emphasis: `_italic_`
- Hash symbols for headers: `## Section Title`
- Backticks for code: `` `inline code` ``
- Triple backticks for code blocks
- Numbers with periods for lists when not rendered: `1. First item`

**Why this happens:** LLMs are trained to output Markdown (used on GitHub, Reddit, Discord, etc.) and sometimes do not translate correctly to the target platform's formatting.

---

### 16. Curly vs. Straight Quotes

**Pattern:** Inconsistent use of curly quotes versus straight quotes or the wrong type for the context.

**Why this signals AI:** Different training data and platforms use different quote styles. LLMs may insert curly quotes in contexts where straight quotes are standard, or vice versa.

---

### 17. Title Case in Headers

**Pattern:** Section headers capitalize every major word (Title Case) instead of using sentence case.

**Examples:**

- AI: "The Evolution Of Modern Technology"
- Human journalism: "The evolution of modern technology"

**Why this signals AI:** Many LLMs default to title case for headers because it is common in certain types of content (marketing, academic), but most journalism uses sentence case.

---

## Technical and Formatting Tells

### 18. Placeholder Text and Incomplete Elements

**Pattern:** Bracketed placeholders left in published content.

**Common examples:**

- `[Insert source here]`
- `[Add specific example]`
- `[URL of reliable source]`
- `[Citation needed]`
- `[Date]`

**Why this happens:** A user copies AI-generated text with placeholders they were supposed to fill in but forgot.

**Variation:** Sometimes appears as XML-like notation: `:contentReference[oaicite:0]`

---

### 19. Chatbot Communication Artifacts

**Pattern:** Text that includes meta-communication between the chatbot and user.

**Examples:**

- Salutations: "Dear [Reader]," "Hello!"
- Valedictions: "Thank you for your time and consideration," "I hope this helps!"
- Instructions to user: "Here is your article on [topic]"
- Knowledge cutoff disclaimers: "As of my last training update in [date]..."
- Disclaimers: "Please consult a professional before..."
- Offers to assist further: "If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"

**Why this is a strong tell:** These phrases reveal that content was generated in response to a prompt and copied without editing.

---

### 20. Broken or Fabricated Links and Technical Codes

**Pattern:** Links, DOIs, ISBNs, or other technical identifiers that do not resolve or are invalid.

**Common issues:**

- URLs that lead to 404 errors
- DOIs that do not resolve to any article
- ISBNs with invalid checksums
- Generic placeholder links: `[Link to source]`
- ChatGPT-specific artifacts like "turn0search0"

**Why this happens:** LLMs hallucinate (fabricate) citations that look credible but do not actually exist.

**Detection method:** Click links, verify DOIs resolve, check ISBNs with checksum validators.

---

### 21. Citation Abnormalities

**Pattern:** References that appear legitimate but reveal AI generation upon inspection.

**Common issues:**

- Citations repeated multiple times without proper reference tagging
- Real sources cited for completely unrelated content
- Citations formatted in unusual or inconsistent styles
- Multiple citations to the same source without variation in attribution
- Generic citations: "According to experts..." without naming the experts

**Example of suspicious pattern:** Multiple identical citations in close proximity rather than using a single citation or cross-referencing.

---

### 22. Suspiciously Long or Elaborate Edit Summaries

**Pattern:** In platforms with edit tracking, unusually long, formal edit summaries written in first-person paragraphs.

**Example:**

"Refined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance."

**Why this signals AI:** Human editors typically write brief, informal edit summaries. LLMs generate formal, comprehensive summaries when prompted to explain changes.

---

## Citation and Sourcing Issues

### 23. Hallucinated Citations

**Characteristics:**

- Sources that sound credible but do not exist
- Misattribution of real sources to incorrect content
- Fabricated quotes from real people
- Non-existent journal articles with plausible-sounding titles
- Books or papers by real authors that do not exist

**Why this is critical:** Hallucinated citations are one of the most dangerous aspects of AI-generated content because they appear authoritative while spreading misinformation.

---

### 24. Vague Attribution to Unnamed Authorities

**Pattern:** Claims attributed to generic, unnamed sources.

**Examples:**

- "Experts say..."
- "Studies have shown..."
- "Research indicates..."
- "Analysts believe..."
- "Industry leaders suggest..."

**Without specific attribution:**

- Which experts?
- Which studies?
- What research?

**Professional standard:** Specific attribution with verifiable sources.

---

## Context-Specific Indicators

### 25. Industry-Specific Slop Patterns

Different domains show characteristic AI patterns:

**Technology writing:**

- Overuse of "innovative," "cutting-edge," "revolutionary"
- Generic descriptions: "robust," "scalable," "flexible"
- Buzzword clustering without substance

**Travel/lifestyle:**

- "Hidden gem," "off the beaten path"
- Excessive descriptors: "picturesque," "charming," "quaint"
- Generic itineraries: "must-see destinations"

**Business/corporate:**

- "Synergy," "leverage," "optimize"
- Mission statement language throughout
- "Game-changing," "paradigm shift"

**Product reviews:**

- Uniformly positive tone
- Generic praise without specific details
- Comparison charts without actual product experience

---

### 26. Lack of Personal Detail, Experience, or Specificity

**Pattern:** Generic descriptions without specific examples, personal anecdotes, or experiential details.

**AI writing:**

"The restaurant offers excellent service and a diverse menu featuring both traditional and innovative dishes."

**Human writing:**

"The waiter recommended the braised short rib after learning I don't eat seafood. The meat fell apart at the touch of my fork, and the red wine reduction had a subtle coffee undertone that lingered."

**Detection principle:** Humans who have experienced something provide specific sensory details, personal reactions, and concrete examples. AI generalizes.

---

### 27. Superficial Depth Without Expertise

**Pattern:** Content covers a topic broadly without demonstrating actual understanding or expertise.

**Characteristics:**

- Restates common knowledge without original insight
- Uses technical terms correctly but superficially
- Avoids controversial or nuanced aspects
- Provides "both sides" artificially balanced treatment
- Lacks specific examples, case studies, or detailed analysis

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs are trained on vast data but lack genuine expertise. They excel at sounding knowledgeable while avoiding depth that would reveal limitations.
